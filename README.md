# Sudoku-Solver
A c++ script that solves sudoku puzzles

## Info
This was an script created for my final project for my CPTR-2300 Data Structures class in college. The script reads a file provided (variable in code) with a specific format (see example .puzzle files), and returns a solved sudoku puzzle. If a puzzle has no solution, it returns as such. I've confirmed it still works as of publishing but do not intend to return to this project.
